This project consists of three parts, focused on forecasting cumulative GDP growth:

Replication: We replicate the results from Table 17.3 in Stock and Watson, Introduction to Econometrics (4th Edition, Global Edition), 
producing forecasts of cumulative GDP growth using different econometric models.

Random Walk Comparison: We generate forecasts using a random walk model and compare them with the models from Part 1.

Improved Forecasting: We introduce a new predictor — 10-year government bond yield — to enhance long-term GDP growth forecasts.

Key Findings:

GDP growth behaves closely to a random walk.

Including the 10-year government bond yield significantly improves long-term forecasts.
