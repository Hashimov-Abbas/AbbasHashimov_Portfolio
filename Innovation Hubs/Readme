This project applies several econometric techniques -
including Difference-in-Differences (DiD), Instrumental Variables (IV), and Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) - 
to analyze the impact of local innovation hubs established across the UK on the creation of new successful businesses.

The analysis estimates that the presence of these innovation hubs increases the probability of an individual starting a business by approximately 5%.
